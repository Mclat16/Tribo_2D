# The first step is transferring the whole h-MoS2 folder to the RDS Home Directory
# This can be done by adding the RDS Path to your file system as seen in
# https://icl-rcs-user-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/rds/paths/ 

# Next, we need to transfer the files to the Ephemeral directory, run the following command:
qsub scripts/h-MoS2/size_100x_100y/sub_aSi/tip_Si_r25/K300/scriptsh-MoS2_transfer.pbs

# Once this is done, you can run the system intialisation as follows:
qsub -W depend=afterok:<XXXX.pbs> scripts/h-MoS2/size_100x_100y/sub_aSi/tip_Si_r25/K300/scriptsh-MoS2_system.pbs

# Where <XXXX.pbs> is the job number given to you after submitting transfer.pbs

# Then we can run the loading as follows:
qsub -W depend=afterany:<XXXX[].pbs> scripts/h-MoS2/size_100x_100y/sub_aSi/tip_Si_r25/K300/scriptsh-MoS2_load.pbs

# Where <XXXX[].pbs> is the job number given to you after submitting system.pbs

# Finally, we can run the sliding as follows:
qsub -W depend=afterany:<XXXX[].pbs> scripts/h-MoS2/size_100x_100y/sub_aSi/tip_Si_r25/K300/scriptsh-MoS2_slide.pbs

# Where <XXXX[].pbs> is the job number given to you after submitting load.pbs

# Transfer your results back to the home directory with:
qsub -W depend=afterany:<XXXX[].pbs> scripts/h-MoS2/size_100x_100y/sub_aSi/tip_Si_r25/K300/scriptsh-MoS2_transfer2.pbs

# Where <XXXX[].pbs> is the job number given to you after submitting slide.pbs

# Make sure to transfer your results and visuals back to your personal computer
